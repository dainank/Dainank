<h2> ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dainank! </h2>

I am Ben (aka @dainank), from :luxembourg:/:uk: but grew up and am currently studying software engineering in The Netherlands.

Additionally, I work at [*Lely*](https://www.lely.com/) as part of the [__*Lely* Vector__ continuous development team](https://www.lely.com/solutions/feeding/vector/), contributing to their flagship cow feeding robot.

Most of my repositories here include **personal endeavors**, **university work** and various **book projects** (from [*Manning*](https://www.manning.com/), great publisher).
