<h2> ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dainank! </h2>

I am **Benjamin** (aka @dainank), from :luxembourg:/:uk: but grew up and am currently studying **software engineering** in **The Netherlands**.

Additionally, I work at [*ASML*]([https://www.lely.com/](https://www.asml.com/en/careers/working-at-asml/netherlands)) as a full-stack software engineer.

Most of my repositories here include **personal endeavors**, **university work** and various **book projects** (from [*Manning*](https://www.manning.com/), great publisher).
