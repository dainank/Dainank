<h2> ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dainank! </h2>

I am Ben (aka @dainank), from :luxembourg:/:uk: but grew up and am currently studying software engineering in The Netherlands.

Additionally, I work at *Lely* as part of the __*Lely* Vector__ team, contributing to their flagship feeding robot.

Most of my repositories here include **personal endeavors**, **university work** and various **book projects** (many from *Manning*, great publisher).
